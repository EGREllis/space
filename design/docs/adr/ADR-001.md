Architectural decision record 001:

Decision: Immutable tail-append ledger

Context:
There are two general ways of tracking resources:
1) A mutable balance per resource
2) An immutable tail-append ledger

Rational:
The ledger is the more valuable choice.  It is auditable and scalable and 
could potentially be sharded. The mutable balance would be harder to reason
about concurrently and almost certainly require pessimistic locking which 
isn't very scalable.
