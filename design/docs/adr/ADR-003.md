Architectural decision record 003:

Decision: Single ledger, atomic multi-agency multi-resource swaps.

Context:

Options:
Single ledger
Sharding by agency
Sharding by resource type

Sharding increases complexity but also increases concurrency under load.
Complexity is especially increased when supporting multi-agency multi-resource swaps.

Multi-agency multi-resource swaps should be recorded atomically for sanity, even though
it potentially reduces throughput, it increases stability.

I might need to revisit this decision.  Sharding would increase concurrency, possibly dramatically.
