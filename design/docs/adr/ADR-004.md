Architectural decision record 004:

Decision: Accounting for resource generation, consumption and spoilage

Context:
To maintain double-entry standards, sources and sinks will be required.

When a resource is generated, say by a mine or farm or solar panel or whatever, the
resouce needs to appear in the ledger against a source that represents resource generation.
Likewise when fuel is intentionally burnt in manuvers a withdrawal from the owner needs to
occur.  There should be a simmilar but separate sink for resources that spoil (waste).

Sources and sinks should be the only entities that have unbalanced entries.
