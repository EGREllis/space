Architectural decision record 002:

Decision: Optimistic locking using compare-and-swap

Context:
There are two generally concurrency strategies:
1) Pessimistic (locking)
2) Optimistic (compare-and-swap)

Pessimistic locking is arguably simpler but less scalable as each locked entity can only
be acted on by one thread and risks deadlocks.  Optimistic concurrency is arguable more 
complex but also more scalable and risks rejecting transactions because the load is too great.
