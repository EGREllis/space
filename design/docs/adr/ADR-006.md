Architectural decision record 006:

Decision: Event sourcing/single ledger in-memory

Context:
The state of the ledger needs to be recoverable in the event of system failure.

Ideally some combination of persisting to the database and replaying events ought to reproduce
the same ledger.  The ledger should also be persisted to a database in batches
(to increase throughput and ensure memory is available for processing - otherwise it will
eventually be exhausted).
